## Hackathon

The goal of this Hackathon is to offer researchers an opportunity to develop and test various algorithms to solve routine geological tasks.

We encourage experts in geology, math and programming to develop ML algorithms using labeled Train dataset and compete with other experts by submitting results of their models on Test dataset. Those results will be evaluated using a task-specific metric and listed first on public and later on private leaderboards.

Find the detailed description of First Break Picking & Horizon Picking tasks below.

## Tasks
 - ### [First Break Picking](./FBP/)

	Objective of this task is to determine as acurately as possible onsets of first arrivals for each seicmic trace in prestack data.

 - ### [Horizon picking](./HP/)

	In this task, we want to determine a set of distinctly visible boundaries on seismic data: they are called horizons, and denote the drastic change in rock properties underneath.

## Hardware

Most of the deep learning applications demand a significant amount of computing power, and seismic tasks are no exceptions. Thankfully, there is a number of resources, that provide free-to-use GPUs. Here is the list with links to tutorials on how to set up your cloud environment:

  - ### [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index)

	Probably, the most known tool for researchers all around the world, that gives you access to either GPU or TPU and is very easy to get going

  - ### [Azure Notebook](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/search/)

	Microsoft Azure also allows you to get a free GPU to use, but comes with more tight memory limitations, than the Google Colab
